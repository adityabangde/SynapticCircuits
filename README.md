# SynapticCircuits 
**AI for Analog Circuit Understanding, Debugging & Improvement**  
*Development in progress — early concept repository.*

SynapticCircuits is an upcoming AI-powered engine designed to analyze and interpret **analog circuits**.  
It will combine SPICE-backed simulation with intelligent reasoning to deliver:

### Circuit Explanation  
Identify roles of R, C, L, transistors, filters, bias networks, and understand how signals flow.

### Circuit Debugging  
Detect wiring mistakes, wrong bias points, unstable configurations, loading issues, and incorrect component values.

###Improvement Suggestions  
Recommend value changes, stability fixes, noise reduction, bandwidth improvements, and better design practices.

The goal is to bring human-level insight to analog circuits — making them easier to learn, analyze, and refine.

More updates coming soon.
